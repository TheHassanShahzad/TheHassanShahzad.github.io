# My Journey into Web-Based AR

I'm particularly proud of this project because it marks my entry into the fascinating world of augmented reality, specifically web-based AR development. For years, I had been captivated by the idea of creating AR applications. I experimented with ARKit and even dabbled with visionOS on the Vision Pro with friends, but nothing materialized into a complete project. I always wished that creating AR experiences could be more accessible and straightforward.

# Discovering the Right Technology Stack

This project began during the early mainstream adoption of Cursor AI. With my one-month free trial, I decided to test its capabilities by challenging it to create a WebXR experience. Starting with a simple GLB model of a chicken from [poly.pizza](https://poly.pizza) and a blank `index.html` file, I asked Cursor to generate an AR experience.

The AI suggested several technology combinations:
- **A-Frame with WebXR**
- **A-Frame with AR.js**
- **Three.js with WebXR**
- **Three.js with AR.js**

Each combination paired a 3D rendering library with an AR framework. After experimenting with all options, I discovered that while WebXR experiences wouldn't function properly in my testing environment, **A-Frame combined with AR.js** produced the most elegant solution with remarkably few lines of code.

## Initial Prototype: The Chicken Demo

The initial proof-of-concept was surprisingly simple yet powerful. Here's the complete code that demonstrates marker-based AR with A-Frame and AR.js:

```html

    <title>AR.js GLB Model Example</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <script src="https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js"></script>
</head>

<body style="margin: 0; overflow: hidden;">
    <a-scene embedded arjs="sourceType: webcam; debugUIEnabled: false;">
        <!-- Add the custom marker -->
        <a-marker preset="hiro">
            <!-- Load GLB model with rotation animation -->
            <a-entity position="0 0 0" scale="0.01 0.01 0.01" rotation="0 0 0"
                      gltf-model="./Chicken.glb"
                      animation="property: rotation;
                                to: 0 360 0;
                                dur: 3000;
                                easing: linear;
                                loop: true">
            </a-entity>
        </a-marker>
        <!-- Add the camera -->
        <a-entity camera></a-entity>
    </a-scene>
</body>
</html>
```

### Key Technical Components

This minimal implementation showcases several important concepts:

- **Marker-based tracking**: Uses the built-in "hiro" marker pattern for reliable object detection
- **3D model rendering**: Loads and displays GLB/GLTF models directly in the browser
- **Real-time animation**: Implements smooth 360-degree rotation using A-Frame's animation system
- **Camera integration**: Accesses device camera for live AR overlay

The development workflow was remarkably simple: run `npx live-server` locally, then use `ngrok http 8080` to make it accessible on mobile devices for testing.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/AR_BusinessCard/chicken.png" title="AR_BusinessCard" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 zoomable=true" %}
    </div>
</div>

## Iterative Development and Experimentation

The simplicity of this initial implementation was eye-opening. With just a few dozen lines of code, I could place a 3D model onto a tracking marker and have it rotate continuously. The rapid prototyping workflow using `live-server` and `ngrok` made mobile testing seamless.

After experimenting with different models and fine-tuning various parameters, I achieved more refined results:

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/AR_BusinessCard/test1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 zoomable=true" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/AR_BusinessCard/test2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 zoomable=true" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/AR_BusinessCard/test3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 zoomable=true" %}
    </div>
</div>


# Building the Complete AR Business Card

After validating the core AR functionality with simple models, I decided to create something more meaningful - an interactive showcase of my robotics portfolio. Using Blender, I compiled 3D models from various robotics projects into a single, cohesive AR experience.

                      gltf-model="./ar_card_1.glb"
                      animation="property: rotation;
                                to: 0 360 0;
                                dur: 6000;
                                easing: linear;
                                loop: true">
            </a-entity>
        </a-marker>
        <a-entity camera></a-entity>
    </a-scene>
</body>
</html>
```

### Technical Improvements

The final implementation includes several key optimizations:

- **Increased scale** (5x) for better visibility and detail of the robotics models
- **Slower rotation** (6 seconds) to allow viewers more time to examine each project
- **Optimized model file** (`ar_card_1.glb`) containing all four robotics projects
- **Enhanced marker tracking** for improved stability across different lighting conditions


# GLB Optimization
The raw file i got by itself was about 50MB. This is obvisouly too large for a website to load and then render. I needed to optimize this. To do so i used https://gltf.report and used draco optimization. Tutning the total file down to less than 10 MB

# Deploying it
Deploying the file was done with netlify. Ive since this project - used it extensively. Its very wasy to deploy websites and test MVPs. If the MVP works i can purchase a custom domain and ammend the DNS that way. Super useful tool.

# Final Results and Demonstration

The completed AR business card successfully demonstrates the power of web-based AR for interactive portfolio presentations. The experience seamlessly blends digital and physical worlds, allowing viewers to explore my robotics projects in an engaging, memorable format.
