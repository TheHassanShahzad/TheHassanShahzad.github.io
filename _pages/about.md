I am a passionate entrepreneur and roboticist, serving as the CEO of **Silkun Innovations**. At Silkun Innovations, I lead two groundbreaking ventures:

- **AR Dining:** Revolutionizing the restaurant experience with 3D, in-browser augmented reality menus. Discover more at [ar-dining.co.uk](https://ar-dining.co.uk).
- **ARIoT:** Pioneering a digital future where augmented reality enables cross-platform shared experiences, allowing users to interact with identical 3D models in real-world spaces without the need for a centralized digital platform.

My journey began at the age of 12 when I started building robots—a passion that has grown into a lifelong commitment. As a second-year undergraduate studying Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at University College London (UCL), I blend academic excellence with hands-on innovation. My extensive experience in **ROS2**, **CAD**, and **SLAM** underpins my work in developing autonomous mobile robots, and I am currently integrating **large language models (LLMs)** in differnt ways to form more fluid human robot interaction.

I am proficient in numerous technical areas which you can understand from the **projects section** of this website. I thrive on transforming complex challenges into innovative solutions. I have a proven track record of combining technical expertise with entrepreneurial vision—a quality that makes me an ideal collaborator and investment partner.

I am eager to connect with professionals specializing in **advanced manufacturing**, **media**, **online marketing**, **law** and **company outreach**. By joining forces with experts from diverse fields, I believe we can push the boundaries of technology and create transformative experiences. If you're driven by innovation and ready to make a significant impact, let's collaborate and shape the future together!
