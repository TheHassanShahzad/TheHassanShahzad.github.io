Been making robots since I was 12. Goals for this year:
- Finish my wheeled semi humanoid (Elo) thats 1.5k
- Build LeBiped - the kit to teach bipedal locomotion policies

Check [my projects page](https://hassan-xr.com/projects/) to see what I'm up to

Next year I plan to make a humanoid from scratch keping the design language and personality from Elo so stay tuned

DM me to talk robots
