I am a second-year undergraduate student studying Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at University College London (UCL). I have worked on various personal projects, which you can explore in the `projects` section of this website. My expertise and interests focus on developing **autonomous mobile robots**, leveraging **ROS** and several packages related to **SLAM** and robot **navigation**. Currently, I am working on projects that integrate **large language models (LLMs)** to enhance robots' understanding of the world and enable more natural, human-like interactions


In addition to my focus on robotics, I am proficient in a variety of programming languages, including **Python** and **C++**, and I frequently use tools like **ROS2**, **PyBullet**, and **Fusion 360** for both simulation and hardware development. I enjoy working collaboratively and am looking to work on more team projects where different people's skill sets can be leveraged to create even better robots.

I am also looking for individuals with experience in **manufacturing**, **PCB design**, and **media** to connect and collaborate on future projects. If you have expertise in these areas, feel free to reach out!
