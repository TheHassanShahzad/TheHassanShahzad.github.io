This is my first blog post to test how things are meant to work. Here is my first paragraph

## First tabs

It seems like a double hashtag is meant to make things a title

I think this is meant for some code:

'''liquid
print("hello world")
print("testing")
'''

now replacing liquid with python 

'''python
print("hello world")
print("testing")
'''

## Image Slider

<swiper-container keyboard="true" navigation="true" pagination="true" pagination-clickable="true" pagination-dynamic-bullets="true" rewind="true">
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/ex1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/ex2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/ex3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
  <swiper-slide>{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/ex4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</swiper-slide>
</swiper-container>

## Jupyter notebook

{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = 'assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb' | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == 'true' %}
  {% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}
  <p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>
{% endif %}
